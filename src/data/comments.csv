I constantly see posts showing up on my Instagram that try to guilt parents about sleep training or promote never letting your baby cry.,instagram,reddit,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/v1syro/do_you_find_that_instagram_is_really_judgmental/
"Is anyone else frustrated by the anti-sleep training mentality on social media? I get that it may work for some babies to skip out on sleep training, but I think some babies will simply not get enough sleep without it.",instagram,reddit,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/v1syro/do_you_find_that_instagram_is_really_judgmental/

I did the <span class=bold>Ferber Method</span> with both of my kids. It took 2 nights for both. They are excellent sleepers and have been ever since. They are teens now and there were no negative repercussions from it. It was by far the best decision I made regarding them.,divided,reddit,228,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqg3rk/

Before we <span class=bold>Sleep Trained</span> he was a terrible sleeper so much so that we didnt average more than 2-3 hours of sleep a day for those first 4 months. We were so tired that we were pretty much delirious. Once he was sleeping better we were able to be much better parents to him because we weren't completely exhausted.,divided,reddit,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqnlr6/

I used to think it was neglectful and abusive. It didn’t align with the “gentle parenting” philosophy I was strictly following at the time. I’ve since become a lot less rigid in my parenting style.  And more importantly I’ve learned not to judge anyones parenting choices.,recent,reddit,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/iksepij/
It is harmful. Insecure attachment in infants *is* a predictor of poor mental health in adulthood. It is an awful thing to do to a baby and I think less of everyone who employs it.,attachment,reddit,-9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqnff2/

It’s called “Cry out method” and its traumatic - results in a feeling of abandonment and may lead to long-term insecurity. Look at the research.,attachment,instagram,11392,https://www.instagram.com/reel/C43zSHGv6t8/?igsh=eDBzMmY4NWJ0cHpv

This is a regimen to help Moms be lazy and justify it. Cry it out creates anxiety when these kids become adults.,lazy,reddit,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/se1y49/sleep_training_baby_damage/
