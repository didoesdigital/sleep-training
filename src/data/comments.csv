I constantly see posts showing up on my Instagram that try to guilt parents about sleep training or promote never letting your baby cry.,confused,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/v1syro/do_you_find_that_instagram_is_really_judgmental/
"Need help. There are so many arguments and counter arguments out there. But I don't want my super active, fun, full of life baby to turn into a 'pretty quiet' baby .",confused,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/se1y49/sleep_training_baby_damage/
"Is anyone else frustrated by the anti-sleep training mentality on social media? I get that it may work for some babies to skip out on sleep training, but I think some babies will simply not get enough sleep without it.",confused,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/v1syro/do_you_find_that_instagram_is_really_judgmental/
"People shaming others for deciding to sleep train their kids with CIO is insane. Allowing your children to sleep in your bed until they’re in college, is your choice. Parents teaching their children to self soothe, is also their choice. I find hundreds of articles that show benefits and cons to both techniques. Everyone needs to have an opinion about everything…. And theirs is always “right.” Our world is degrading quicker and quicker.",confused,instagram,https://www.instagram.com/reel/C43zSHGv6t8/?igsh=eDBzMmY4NWJ0cHpv

"We did CIO at 4.5 months, cried 5 minutes, has slept 12 hours a night ever since. It’s a dream. Parenting is hard and there isn’t a lot that is easy.

I did the Ferber Method with both of my kids. It took 2 nights for both. They are excellent sleepers and have been ever since. They are teens now and there were no negative repercussions from it. It was by far the best decision I made regarding them.,divided,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqg3rk/

Before we sleep trained he was a terrible sleeper so much so that we didnt average more than 2-3 hours of sleep a day for those first 4 months. We were so tired that we were pretty much delirious. Once he was sleeping better we were able to be much better parents to him because we weren't completely exhausted.,divided,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqnlr6/
"Letting babies or toddlers ""cry it out"" is child abuse. Crying is the only way your child can communicate that something is wrong. There is no fence to sit on.",divided,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqn58q/
I'm firmly against it. I did it with my first and it felt extremely anxiety inducing and unnatural.,divided,reddit,
I used to think it was neglectful and abusive. It didn’t align with the “gentle parenting” philosophy I was strictly following at the time. I’ve since become a lot less rigid in my parenting style.  And more importantly I’ve learned not to judge anyones parenting choices.,divided,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/iksepij/
"the “old school” way we were told to, it’s straight up harmful. If your kid is left to scream until they give up because they know nobody is coming to help them, yeah that’s trauma.

Leaving your child to scream in order to teach them that screaming for help is futile is cruel. It is harmful. Insecure attachment in infants *is* a predictor of poor mental health in adulthood. It is an awful thing to do to a baby and I think less of everyone who employs it.,attachment,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqnff2/
"I work with folks with complex trauma every day, so I hope that I observe, and have some awareness and even responsibility to help with the consequences of outright neglect. And sleep training is not it. If infant attachment were as fragile as you seem to imply, and a single or even a handful of instances of being not responded to damaged it irreparably, we would all have chaotic attachment styles. Yet the large majority of infants, whether parents sleep train them or not, display secure attachment.",attachment,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikt0z7f/
"There was a study at some orphanage in Europe somewhere where the researcher asked why the babies don’t cry, why they’re able to self soothe so well, and the orphanage worker said that they just stopped crying because they learned that no one was coming for them.

It’s called “Cry out method” and its traumatic - results in a feeling of abandonment and may lead to long-term insecurity. Look at the research.,attachment,instagram,https://www.instagram.com/reel/C43zSHGv6t8/?igsh=eDBzMmY4NWJ0cHpv

"Chronic stress in infancy can also lead to an over-active adrenaline system, causing anti-social and aggressive behavior, and even affect physical illness far into the future. Using saliva swab tests, scientists have been able to measure high levels of the stress hormone cortisol in distraught babies whose cries elicit no response from parent or carer. Neurobiologists say, according to Leach, that high cortisol levels are “toxic” to the developing brain.",brain damage,instagram,https://www.instagram.com/reel/C43zSHGv6t8/?igsh=eDBzMmY4NWJ0cHpv

I do not understand how anyone could let their baby cry. If you are overwelmed. Ask someone to come over and remove yourself from the baby.,lazy,instagram,https://www.instagram.com/reel/C43zSHGv6t8/?igsh=eDBzMmY4NWJ0cHpv

Families have slept together at night for most of history. It's only relatively recently that we started sleeping separately. Our toddlers cry when we put them in their own room because it's an instinct for them not to be separated from us. ,recent,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqhv5b/
"The ""west"" is in a big pickle because you can't teach this intellectually, it has to be felt from the insides (interoception) of the parent, for it to work. And therein lies the problem: so many adults are tied up in deep nervous system dysregulation, so they can't feel and assess their biological needs, let alone an infants.",western,instagram,https://www.instagram.com/reel/C43zSHGv6t8/?igsh=eDBzMmY4NWJ0cHpv
