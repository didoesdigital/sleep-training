She’s been changed, snack, watered. Am I missing any other checks?\n\nEdit 2 - thanks guys. It’s really interesting reading the research and methods and mostly your experiences. Never expected to get so many comments.\n\nEdit 3 - (update &amp; overview) wow the amount of comments is absolutely mind blowing. I cannot keep up. So she was up at 1:30am, I think she’s now down and it’s 4:11am. I’m now wide awake so will have to be grateful for my 3 hours I had before she woke up. Gotta go work in a 4 hours. So we spent a lot of time cuddling and watching tv. Tried her in the buggy with an automated rocker (some times works) and tried to put her back in her cot 3 times before the final 4th. She even let me to the cot one of those times but then realised very quickly she didn’t wanna be in it. On the fourth time she got the hump and wouldn’t even hold my hand but through sheer tiredness has passed out. \n\nIt’s really interesting to hear every one’s experiences and opinions. I do wish to clarify. We have a strict bedtime routine (bath, warm milk then bed) will expand this and adapt this as time passes. I feel to young for the story. It would bore her awake) \n\nI have done any sleep training and have always wondered the what ifs. \n\nIt seems from every thing I have read there’s a strong divide between views and opinions as expected but I just wanted every one to take away from this that every child is different and requires different needs. But ultimately we all agree that as long as ur child is loved and cared for, then your doing some thing right. \n\nMy only comment for those whom are strongly against all methods of sleep training…. I ask you to ponder if it is worth trying if it means for some people saving a marriage, saving a job (which can lead to bigger problems including mortgages, bills and even putting food on the table, then I ask please just keep in mind that every ones situation is different and every ones situation is individual.

I do not mean that in the sense of them *wanting* it; I mean that it is a profound survival instinct driving their need for their parents. Human babies are helpless compared to other mammals. Their neurological development is spurred primarily by social interaction. Human babies who are not touched, held or interacted with *will* fail to thrive. Not being given attention weakens their immune systems, raises the risk of SIDS - it can straight up kill them. And on an instinctive level, they know that.\n\nA baby who is left alone does *not* understand you are coming back. They do not ‘learn’ that you are coming back. Their instincts are telling them they have been abandoned and they are going to die. They use their only tool to communicate their terror - crying for help - and their parents ignore them to their face, put them down, and walk away.\n\nThe studies which have been done to monitor the distress levels of children left to cry it out are universally conclusive. The babies’ systems flood with stress hormones, their blood pressure goes up, and they show every biological sign of serious distress. Now, importantly, you need to understand that in the phase where parents say the baby then “calms down” and “learns” to sleep, what the biometrics say is that *the baby remains in that heightened state of distress until they eventually pass out from sheer exhaustion*.\n\nThe quiet is not calm; it is a child who is utterly terrified becoming too exhausted to sustain calling for help, and accepting that *their parents will not help them when they are in need*.\n\nBabies left to “cry it out” do indeed become less demanding. They in effect shut down; they cease communicating their needs to their parents, emotional or physical, because they have learned that their parents will not meet their needs.\n\nBeginning to employ “cry it out” - or as you can more accurately call it, beginning to purposefully neglect your baby in order to make them more compliant for your own convenience - pretty immediately results in the baby’s attachment behaviours toward their parents degrading. They very visibly start to behave as if their parents are no longer a safe place or a source of comfort. All while their parents beam proudly about how well they have “trained” their child, the same way some owners brag about training a dog by starving it until it complies.\n\nSpeaking as a mental health professional - I loathe having to work with patients who are treating their children like this, because I have to keep my cool face on and slowly work with them to improve their ability to connect with their children and push back against these damaging practices, without being able to just say *what the hell is wrong with you? Don’t you understand that screaming means they are upset? What is being communicated here isn’t a fucking mystery!*\n\nBut I can say that online to people I don’t have a professional relationship with!\n\nLeaving your child to scream in order to teach them that screaming for help is futile is cruel. It is harmful. Insecure attachment in infants *is* a predictor of poor mental health in adulthood. These “parenting” methods have a direct caUnited States of Americative link with insecure attachment.

I was afraid to drive most days because I was so tired.  It was becoming literally dangerous.  I started wishing I was the kind of person that would sleep train.

I still try rocking her to sleep to maintain a settling down routine and she straight up fights me, like pushes away and says “down” until I give up and lay her in her crib.  It’s wild and amazing.

All of them had a bedtime routine and a relatively consistent sleep time. A routine is what will help the most I think. When they know what is happening next, it doesn’t seem so scary. So, it’s bath, brush teeth, pjs, story, lights out. When they were around your daughters age (my youngest actually is 23 months, so not far off from your child) if they were doing a constant cry/scream/yell situation nobody was sitting around just listening. We go in, check to make sure they are ok. Sometimes it was as small as they can’t find Teddy. Other times it was because they were teething. If it’s a health issue (cold/congestion or teething pains) we deal with that. Otherwise, we Let them know that it’s time to sleep, it’s not time to play (if talking/playing is what they were crying for). Depending on how young, rub their back or pat their legs softly. We did not pick them up unless they seemed like something was hurting them. But we let them kno we were there. And some of our kids needed more attention than others. And that’s ok because every child is different. But they all have the same routine, still. And all four of them are great sleepers. The 3yo wakes up occasionally because he is potty training and has to potty overnight sometimes. The baby wakes up occasionally because he needs a new diaper. Potty/diaper change in as little light as necessary and back to bed. Give them lots of kisses. Let them know you love them and will be there when they wake in the morning. \n\nCIO is not abandoning your child. It’s supposed to be assessing the situation. Sometimes kids are sick. Assess and help. Sometimes they need more kisses or a blanket. Simple enough. Assess and help. Sometimes kids just want to play at night.

Suddenly I could nap (I’ve never been able to nap) for sometimes up to an hour during baby’s 2 hour naps. For someone who struggles to sleep more than 3 hours a day, this was absolutely life altering. When my maternity leave was over we shifted the routine to my partner, who was going back to school, and he handled bedtime from there out - that actually made weaning way easier when it came time, because my kid was already used to his dad putting him to bed at night. Then Covid hit and I was laid off, so I napped with little bud every day and his dad did bedtime routine. \n\nMy kid is an excellent sleeper and kept his 2 hour nap until about a month ago (he’s 4.5).

When you’re parenting your child, they will get mad or upset at you — preventing that from happening does nobody any favors. I also believe that there is a lot of projecting going on when people say babies feel abandoned by their parents while crying it out. I personally believe parenting — teaching kids how to become functioning, awesome people — starts when they’re infants. I’m not going to judge people who run in to address every cry and whimper a baby makes, but it certainly doesn’t feel like the right move for me or my children. My kids are now 7 and 9 and they are incredibly kind, empathetic, smart, confident, responsible young humans who know that I’ve got their back if things are tough but they also know that I’m going to ask them to try and solve their problem on their own first before I step in. That’s always been my motivation with parenting. I’m never going to clear obstacles or challenges out of their way, I want them to learn how to overcome them on their own first.

For 3 years he never slept much more than 2 hours at a time, dropped all naps by 18 months (and yeah we tried “quiet time” instead of naps, he refused). I don’t know if it was part of why he was like this, but we were under a lot of pressure (and new parents ourselves with 0 clue what we were doing) from older family members who kept saying it “wasn’t normal” that at less than 2 months old he wasn’t sleeping through the night in a crib in his own room. We were told by numerous people to just “let him cry himself out a couple times, he’ll figure out how to self soothe quickly”. So, for hours every night we let him, a 2 month old, scream and scream until he either passed out or gave up. And then he was awake in 2 hours anyway. He’s 6, and still has major anxiety surrounding sleep, and I honestly think it’s because he learned from us having him “cry it out” when it was 31 flavours of wrong, that he is not safe going to sleep/ bed. I hate myself for giving in and doing that to him.\n\nOur youngest, slept in a bassinet next to our bed for 9 months, we transitioned him to a crib slowly (bassinet in the room next to the crib for a week etc) and we never let him cry more than 5-10 minutes max. He sleeps SO much better than his brother did at his age. \n\nBecause of my experience, i do think CIO needs to be done with strict parameters, and i think done the “old school” way we were told to, it’s straight up harmful. If your kid is left to scream until they give up because they know nobody is coming to help them, yeah that’s trauma. I remember being told that when he went quiet, that meant he was self-soothing. He wasn’t. He wasn’t in any way at all “soothed”, he was just laying wide awake in the dark looking lost and lonely. He just knew he might as well stop crying for help because nobody was coming.","If your kid is left to scream until they give up because they know nobody is coming to help them, yeah that’s trauma.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqpoym/","livin_la_vida_mama",{"comment":1683,"short":1684,"position":6,"radius":585,"url":1685,"username":1686,"type":989},"Yes, it was terrible but I told myself over and over millions of babies have done this, people forget to charge monitor and it dies and who knows if their baby cried it out- they all were fine.

When my second child came along, I was worried that it was a flUnited Kingdome with my first that she only cried a little bit for two nights and that I couldn’t get the same results with baby #2. When #2 hit the same age/weight milestones, I did the same with her and had the same results: night one, 15-20 minutes of crying, night 2, five minutes of crying, night three, sleeping through the night. It was incredible and changed our family for the better. They are now 9 and 7 years old and we are so close to each other, they don’t have trust issues, they are psychologically healthy and not broken because I let them cry for what some might call an extended period of time when they were babies. \n\nI understand that this may not be for everyone—there are plenty of things that were not for me.

I was adamantly against it. For the first several months of her life, my daughter was an excellent sleeper and I felt very comfortable in my anti-sleep training stance.  \n\n\nThen at 8mo she went through an awful regression. She went to bed fine, but she started only sleeping for 40-90 minutes at a time. She would wake up SCREAMING and only fall asleep if we were holding her. She would scream every time we tried to put her back in the crib. I'm only 5' tall so I could barely reach the mattress of the crib to try to put her down asleep, and she is such a light sleeper that it would wake her up most of the time anyway. I had some success with using a heating pad to heat her crib before I put her down and make the transition less jarring, but eventually that stopped working too.   \n\n\nI would spend hours and hours trying to get her back into the crib. I went entire nights with zero sleep and started having health issues and mental breakdowns because of it. I'm a SAHM, so I did all the overnight stuff by myself after 10pm because my husband needed sleep for his very detail-oriented job.   \n\n\nI tried every gentle training method I could find. I spent hours researching. None of it worked. Either of us being in the room made her more upset 100% of the time, unless we were rocking her to sleep but by this time it was impossible to put her down asleep. She woke up immediately every time.  \n\n\nFinally my husband put his hands on my shoulders and told me we needed to try some form of CIO. He said he was worried about me and that it was not healthy for me to continue this way, and that in order for me to be able to parent our child I needed sleep. He was absolutely right. I was at the point where I was feeling delusional from lack of sleep and it was not safe for me or my daughter. We decided to try a timed CIO method where if she was crying we would go in every 25 minutes, comfort her, put her back down in the crib (she would start crying again immediately), and leave. We have a video monitor and if she seemed like she was starting to settle down, we would extend the timer and not disturb her.   \n\n\nI felt sooooooooooo much guilt and had to wear noise cancelling headphones during the 25 minute timer. But it worked amazingly well. Within a week she was sleeping great and rarely crying when she woke up, she would just go back to sleep. She started waking up in a great mood instead of being cranky every morning. I felt like a human being again. We've had to retrain a few times and now that she's 2yo and understands more, we're able to use more gentle methods which I prefer.

But with your edit I'm curious about what *you* mean by CIO.\n\nCIO in general is usually tied to sleep training - wherein if your baby cries when you put them in their crib you let them cry (indefinitely or for a certain period of time) so they can \"self-soothe\" and essentially extinguish the crying response in that circumstance. We had a rule with my first that we'd never let him cry more than 5 minutes and when he was a baby we were never tested on it -- he fussed for 1-2 minutes and then was fine.\n\nThat said, I'm of the opinion that sleep training in general doesn't really work and that kids \"regress\" in that training basically at every milestone, which means you just have to go through the whole process again. Which can get pretty harrowing quickly. Better to establish good sleep hygiene and then support as needed.\n\nAs far as babies and kids crying in GENERAL: i believe it's totally healthy and normal. I also believe that kids can't really regulate themselves on their own until they're around 4, so if my kid is going to have a massive cry I am going to be there for it. Usually just being there to calmly support my kid ends the tantrum or the crying spell fairly quickly, but on the odd occasion it doesn't I just ride the wave with him, I don't leave him alone -- I think that just makes it scarier for him. FWIW I don't think it's the same as CIO if your baby is crying and you're there. crying isn't bad -- crying alone is.\n\nthat said sometimes it's better to let them cry on their own for a bit if you're feeling like you've hit your limit and need a break.","I was pro CIO when my first was born and I'm against CIO for the most part now.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqrldy/","Fishgottaswim78",{"comment":1895,"short":1896,"position":6,"radius":571,"url":1897,"username":1898,"type":989},"When I was sleep training my LO, it was tough to go through with that and have my husband argue with me every step of the way (couldn't stand listening to him cry....I don't think he realized JUST how much it affected him)\n\nBut I would let him cry it out in increasing intervals from 2 or 3 minutes.

CIO is better for younger babies with simpler minds who can't understand you talk. The 6-9 month old baby has nothing else to do in the crib other than cry or try to sleep. You can't explain to a 6-9 mo baby that he can fall asleep without being rocked or nursed to sleep, he should just close his eyes and relax and sleep will come. So you leave them alone and hope that he figures it out eventually when he's sufficiently tired. \n\nBut a 20 mo probably already knows that it's possible to fall asleep without help (unless you are still rocking them to sleep?)

Plus a 20 mo can try to climb out of the crib/bed, bang their head against the crib, take off their diaper, and all kinds of unpredictable and possibly dangerous stuff.\n\nMany toddlers who were previously sleep-trained will have sleep regressions at around 1.5-2.5 yo because of the emergence of said complicated feelings. The parents may have to sit with the kid until they fall asleep, for a period of weeks or months, before the toddler is once again \"settled\" and is okay with a quick goodnight.\n\nTLDR: IMO CIO is for infants, not toddlers.","I'm all for CIO, but 20 months old is too old for it.

Babies are completely new beings and they have no idea how anything works but what they do know is that mom/main care giver=same person as baby and they don’t stop believing that until they are around 7m old. I don’t understand why people don’t want to just soothe the baby. Letting it cry doesn’t teach self soothing to a baby who doesn’t even know what they are feeling in the first place. It teaches them that the caregiver isn’t going to answer their cries. There are way better ways to teach your child to soothe themselves at a reasonable age. If it’s about sleep, it’s completely normal for babies to wake for comfort reasons and food.

Think of it this way; when you’re baby was a newborn, baby would wake up during the night because baby would have to feed. As baby grows, the routine of waking stays but they don’t actually need to feed. The “cry it out” is trying to break the routine by giving baby time during night to self soothe / realize they aren’t hungry. In my experience, if the crying turned into full blown meltdown, I’d go in - hug and sing to soothe then put baby down to go back to sleep. Worked like a charm for us, baby goes into the crib awake for naps and nighttime and falls asleep almost instantly. Baby has been sleeping through the night (7pm - 6am) since 12 months old.","Worked like a charm for us, baby goes into the crib awake for naps and nighttime and falls asleep almost instantly.

Do you shut it down or ensure they feel supported during those vulnerable times.

I was very nervous about letting her cry it out as well, believing that it meant she needed me or needed the comfort. I don’t use any specific night-time routine with her either so she’s not overly attached to a specific rhythm. \n\nI just keep the daytime schedule the same for her, and at night she’s predictably tired around the same time, give or take half an hour. I make her as comfortable as I can by making sure she’s dry and has a full tummy and put her down. She’ll cry the second I set her down in the crib but I’ll just say goodnight, walk away to where she can’t see me and then listen to how she cries. If she starts crying slower and softer then she’s just fighting sleep, if she cries steady for more than about 10 minutes I’ll peek at her to see if she’s okay (usually she just manages to get her legs through the sides of the crib and is uncomfortable) but I otherwise will not intervene or attempt to comfort unless her cries sound like she’s becoming distressed which isn’t very often.

Rather, babies who have CIO just cry less when they do wake up in the middle of the night. They don’t necessarily go back to sleep faster, they just stop asking their parents to comfort them. The point of the article basically said, do CIO if you as a parent don’t have the ability to comfort your child back to sleep, but don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re doing it for the child. The child doesn’t “learn how to comfort themself” as a lot of CIO proponents suggest, they just stop asking for help (by crying).\n\nI’m pretty biased, my wife and I have coslept with our 18mo old since birth (although we’re now transitioning him to a little mattress next to ours on the floor because we have a second on the way. Regardless of what the research says, my core belief is that CIO teaches your kid that you will not meet a need they have. Now, is that going to irreparably harm your kid, no? We can’t reasonably meet every single need our kids have, and there are plenty of other ways you can meet your kids needs. Comforting them to sleep is just one way to do so. And, I think that if comforting your child to sleep is making a parent miserable and sleep-deprived, it’s better to be a well rested happy parent than a sleep deprived bitter parent.\n\nSo, ultimately I think it depends on the kid and the parent, really on the parent. I don’t know of any kids who respond poorly to being comforted to sleep. I have heard horror stories of CIO gone wrong, like kids ending up with really disregulated sleep patterns. The complaint I hear about comforting to sleep is that the parents get tired of it at some point or can’t figure out a way to do it effectively so they can also get enough rest. \n\nSo, I think the choice should really be made based on what you as a parent think you’re capable of (being honest with yourself is ok), and also seeing how your kid responds. Like, some kids seem to take better to CIO than others. I think the danger of CIO is that a lot people say to keep doing it until it works because it eventually will. I don’t think that’s true. If you are going to do it, set a limit on how many days/wks you’re willing to try it out, and if your kid doesn’t respond, stop.","So, I think the choice should really be made based on what you as a parent think you’re capable of (being honest with yourself is ok), and also seeing how your kid responds.

Even as an infant. There was day time and there was night time. As an infant - night time starts at the last feeding before we go to bed(usually around 8pm). What that means is infant eats, burps, is swaddled and laid down. We don't snuggle, play, pick her up or anything until its time to eat again. When its time to eat, we unwrap her, change her, feed her, burp her and right back in the swaddle and right back down. This worked for our (now two year old) who has been sleeping through the night since she was 3 months old. This sets them up to understand that night time is bed time, even if the infant needs to eat every few hours she'll have this routine with her forever. Night time is not a time for cuddles or play - its a time to sleep. \n\nThe two year old gets a wind-down routine: quiet play an hour before bed (no screens!), potty (in training), teeth brushed, changed into jammies and sleep sack, pick a stuffie to bring with you then we rock her and read a book while she drinks her milk, then bed. I'm a little lenient and let her pick a few books to read if she wants, but by the second or third book she's done. If she's up early in the morning and we're not ready to get her up, she sits in her crib and sings and plays for no more than an hour before we get her. \n\nAt times you HAVE to let them cry it out. All you ever teach a child who cries and gets attention is that they will ALWAYS get attention by acting like that. Our two year old has gone through two different sleep regressions where she was tough to put down and keep down or she'd pop back up with the slightest sound and start screaming. DO NOT CODDLE THEM! Though extraordinarily painful we once let her cry for an hour straight after several 'resets' and attempts and you know what - she went down. Its heart breaking and at times feels cruel - but you will all get through it. The regressions each lasted about a week, and each time we introduced new factors to sort of reset her brain.\n\nI would never change this routine for my kids. It worked extremely well for our two year old and our infant often times has to be woken up to eat at night.

Before we sleep trained he was a terrible sleeper so much so that we didnt average more than 2-3 hours of sleep a day for those first 4 months. We were so tired that we were pretty much delirious. Once he was sleeping better we were able to be much better parents to him because we weren't completely exhausted. My 2nd is currently 3.5months and he already sleeps a solid 6hr chunk at night and then will wake up every 2 hours after that until morning which is normal. We probably wont sleep train him beyond breaking some sleep associations he has.
